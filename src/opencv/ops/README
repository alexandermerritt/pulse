what if i had categories of images... 
    sets of faces
    sets of buildings
    sets of other stuff

show that algorithms in search of something specific have different runtimes?
    face detection
    object classification
    other stuff

but what to do regarding image scaling? maybe not a problem

make
./feature [surf|hog] directory/of/jpegs
