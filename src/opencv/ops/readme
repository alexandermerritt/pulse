feature.cpp has a library destructor function that dumps /proc/*/maps
which allows you to see where dynamic libraries have been loaded

use ltrace to capture the dyanmic cuda calls made

    (ltrace -T -C -e '*cuda*' ./feature [args..] 2>&1) > ltrace.cuda

when you see an address in a cuda call:
i) look at which range of mapped memory it belongs to
ii) calculate the offset into that range
iii) do reverse lookup to find symbol:
    readelf -s --wide /path/to/lib | grep <offset>

note: you can demangle c++ symbols yourself with c++filt
