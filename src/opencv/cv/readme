Files copied from opencv sources modules/highgui/src/ to allow
decoding of images from their on-disk format to a cv::Mat without
using the file system. These files are not part of the OpenCV API
(used by cv::imread) and accessible only internally.

Files are unmodified. Added precomp.hpp to make changes to support
compilation (since most of them include this already).
