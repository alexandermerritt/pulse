memcache.py is the python library for memcached
It requires six, a compatibility library
Both are small enough to directly include.
This was done because RHEL is old and only has python2.6

./read-images.py will open 'imagelist'. Each line is a path to an
image object. It will dump out the image properties for each.

./load-images.py will launch memcached with multiple 'factor' values
and load images into the server to measure overall memory usage.
Requires input file 'imagelist'.
